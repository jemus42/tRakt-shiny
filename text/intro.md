## Hi there.
<p class = "lead">This is `tRakt` or `tRakt_shiny` or whatever (naming stuff is hard).</p>

<p class = "lead">It's a tool to look up tv shows from <a href = 'http://trakt.tv' target = '_blank'>trakt.tv</a> <sup><small>which y'all should use anyway</small></sup> and receive some more or less fancy data, including plots with reasonable amounts of fancyness.</p>

### How do you even stuff

* Enter a show title in the search box below 
* **Or** select one from the cache and leave the search box empty
* You can fiddle around with the plot with the inputs on the right
* Or just look at the dataTables, idunno

<small>Also, pls tell me about bugs 'n stuff, k?</small>
