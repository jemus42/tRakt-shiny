## Hi there.
<p class = "lead">This is `tRakt` or `tRakt_shiny` or whatever (naming stuff is hard).</p>

<p class = "lead">It's a tool to look up tv shows from <a href = 'http://trakt.tv'>trakt.tv</a> and receive some more or less fancy data, including plots with reasonable amounts of fancyness.</p>

### How do you even stuff

* Enter a show title in the search box below 
* **Or** select one from the cache and leave the search box empty
* You can fiddle around with the plot with the inputs on the right
* Or just look at the dataTables, idunno


### Or even better

Try the new version at [attrakttv.tadaa-data.de](https://attrakttv.tadaa-data.de/).  

It's tremendously less terrible from the back-end side, and hopefully a lot better on the user experience side.
