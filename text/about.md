## What

This is a shiny version of a bunch of experiments with the <trakt.tv> API in R.  
It is highly experimental, early in development and pretty much brokenâ€¦ ish.  
If you want to look at it or help out, the source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jemus42/tRakt-shiny).  

You may already know/knew [grapthv](http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com), which does/did a much smoother job of displaying tv show ratings,  
but its functionality is fairly basic, and I intend to exceed it with this project.   
Besides, I prefer [trakt](http://trakt.tv) over IMDb for tv show data, even if trakt doesn't nearly have the userbase of IMDb.  
It's a familiarity thing. <small>Also, trakt has a public API</small>

Soo... Even if I'll never reach the smoothness/speed of graphtv,  
I can at least try do some other interesting stuff with the data.  
At least I hope so.  
We'll see.
