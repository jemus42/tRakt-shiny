# tRakt-shiny

This is `tRakt-shiny` (dummy name) version `1.0.0`. 

Using the [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv) API to graph show data and stuff.  
To run it locally, use `shiny::runGitHub(username = "jemus42", repo = "tRakt-shiny")`,
but you'd need to install some dependencies beforehand.
Maybe you'd rather look at [trakt.jemu.name](https://trakt.jemu.name) to see it liveâ„¢.

## Dependencies

* [tRakt](https://github.com/jemus42/tRakt) with its dependencies
* See `DESCRIPTION`. You can use `devtools::install_deps()` to... install... the deps.

## What this should be soon:

[graphtv.kevinformatics.com](http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com), but with more R, more [trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv), and such and such.
